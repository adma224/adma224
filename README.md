# Hi, I'm Adrian Murillo

I'm an AWS Cloud Architect and Machine Learning Engineer based in Costa Rica and I focus on designing scalable cloud systems and deploying ML pipelines that deliver real business value. 

## What I Do

- **AWS Solutions Architecture** – Architecture Planning, VPC design, Serverless/Kubernetes backends, and cost-optimized deployments  
- **Machine Learning Engineering** – Model Training and Deployment, SageMaker pipelines, and MLOps best practices  
- **Cloud DevOps & Delivery** – CI/CD automation, GitHub Actions workflows, IaC via Terraform or CDK CloudFormation

> I bring hands-on experience delivering complete cloud-native solutions — from requirements and scoping to deployment and documentation.

## Featured Projects

### [Kubernetes Cluster in AWS with Terraform and Secure CI/CD](https://github.com/adma224/cloud-native-eks-platform)
A production-style VPC and Amazon EKS cluster entirely with Terraform, including public/private subnets, NAT, and routing. A GitHub Actions pipeline (OIDC-secured, no long-lived keys) builds and pushes a Flask container to Amazon ECR, then deploys it onto the cluster.

**Tech:** `Kubernetes - EKS` • `Terraform` • `CI/CD` • `GitHub Actions` • `OpenID`

### [Generative ML Inference Pipeline on AWS](https://github.com/adma224/ml-inference-pipeline-aws)
A modular, production-style ML inference pipeline built with SageMaker, Lambda, and API Gateway. Enables real-time A/B testing between models with feedback logging, cost tracking, and CI/CD automation. Designed to scale, document itself, and adapt to evolving business goals.

**Tech:** `CloudFormation` • `SageMaker Serverless` • `Lambda` • `API Gateway` • `Aurora` • `GitHub Actions` • `CloudWatch`

### [Serverless Multi-AZ WordPress Infrastructure on AWS Fargate](https://github.com/adma224/serverless-containerized-wordpress)
A scalable, secure, multi-AZ WordPress setup using AWS Fargate for containers, Aurora Serverless for the database, and EFS for file persistence. Built for rapid deployment via CloudFormation, with DNS handled by Route 53.

**Tech:** `CloudFormation` • `Fargate` • `Aurora Serverless` • `Route 53` • `EFS` • `ALB` • `VPC`
