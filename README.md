# Hi, I'm Adrian Murillo

I'm an AWS Cloud Architect and Machine Learning Engineer based in Costa Rica, focused on designing scalable cloud systems and deploying ML pipelines that deliver real business value. I specialize in consulting for early-stage startups, dev teams, and small businesses looking to modernize their infrastructure or ship intelligent products quickly.

## What I Do

- **AWS Solutions Architecture** – VPC design, CDK stacks, serverless backends, and cost-optimized deployments  
- **Machine Learning Engineering** – Model packaging, SageMaker pipelines, and MLOps best practices  
- **Cloud DevOps & Delivery** – CI/CD automation, GitHub Actions workflows, infrastructure as code, and testing strategies  

> I bring hands-on experience delivering complete cloud-native solutions — from requirements and scoping to deployment and documentation.
